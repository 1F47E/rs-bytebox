A command line tool for encrypting and decrypting files using any file as a key

===== What it's all about

To generate a strong 32-byte key from a user-provided file, 
Bytebox uses the scrypt key derivation function. 

===== WHY IT'S SO SLOW?

Key derivation functions like scrypt, PBKDF2, and bcrypt are specifically designed to make brute-force attacks more difficult. They do this by introducing a work factor (also known as iteration count or cost factor) which slows down the process of deriving a key from a password.

===== LINKS

For the actual encryption and decryption, we rely on the AES.
